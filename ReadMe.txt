Neural network implementation with variable number of hidden dimensions. Softmax non-lin√©arity from hidden layers to output layer. Initialized with a tuple containing the number of neurons
in each layer. datapath (string containing the path to the dataset), n_classes (number to classes in the problem), epsilon (a number between 0 and 1 used to clip probabilities that are too 
large or too small), lr (the learning rate for gradient descent), batch_size (batch size for gradient descent), seed (used to control the random numbers generated), activation (string that
describes the activation function from 1 layer to another)
